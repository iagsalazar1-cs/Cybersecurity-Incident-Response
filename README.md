# Cybersecurity Incident Response

### About this Repository

This repository serves as a portfolio of my hands-on experience in cybersecurity incident response, threat analysis, and security monitoring. Each project write-up includes a detailed methodology, analysis of findings, and documentation of my workflow to demonstrate practical skills in a professional context.

### Project Write-Ups & Labs

#### IR Certification Case Studies (CTF Challenges)

* [**One of Us:**](https://github.com/iagsalazar1-cs/Cybersecurity-Incident-Response/tree/main/01-One-of-Us) This project documents a cybersecurity challenge focused on identifying a malicious file and its hash signature. The solution involved using custom Python scripts to automate file scanning and analyze the results, successfully identifying the malicious artifact.

* [**Pigs Rules:**](https://github.com/iagsalazar1-cs/Cybersecurity-Incident-Response/tree/main/02-Pigs-Rules) A write-up detailing the development and deployment of a custom Snort IDS rule to detect and alert on malicious network activity, showcasing skills in intrusion detection system configuration.

* [**Imperial Memory:**](https://github.com/iagsalazar1-cs/Cybersecurity-Incident-Response/tree/main/03-Imperial-Memory) This project involved a memory forensics challenge where a memory dump and a 7-Zip archive were analyzed to uncover a hidden secret, demonstrating skills in digital forensics and artifact analysis.

* [**Mail n' Trail:**](https://github.com/iagsalazar1-cs/Cybersecurity-Incident-Response/tree/main/04-Mail-n-Trail) This write-up covers the analysis of Splunk logs to investigate suspicious honeypot activity and uncover the source of malicious downloads, highlighting my experience with SIEM tools and log correlation.

#### Hands-On Labs **(In progress...)**

* [**Splunk Dashboard and Alert Creation:**](https://github.com/iagsalazar1-cs/Cybersecurity-Incident-Response/tree/main/05-Splunk-Dashboard-Alert-Creation) This project details the creation and customization of Splunk dashboards for visualizing HTTP 404 errors and the configuration of real-time alerts for proactive monitoring.

* [**Wazuh Deployment in VirtualBox - FIM, Custom Rules, and Active Response:**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/iagsalazar1-cs/Cybersecurity-Incident-Response/tree/main/06-Wazuh-Deployment-FIM-Custom-Rules-Active-Response) This project details the establishment of a Wazuh security system in VirtualBox, focusing on File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) configuration, custom rule creation for threat detection, and the implementation of automated active response mechanisms. 

* **Wazuh Deployment in VirtualBox - Windows 10 Agent & Log Management**

* **Network Attack Investigation in Wireshark**
