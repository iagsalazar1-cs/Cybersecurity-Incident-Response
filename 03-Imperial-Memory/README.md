# Imperial Memory - TDX Arena Certification Report

### Executive Summary

The primary goal of this investigation was to analyze a memory dump and a `7-Zip` archive with an encrypted file to uncover a hidden secret. This involved inspecting the memory dump for clues, with a focus on process memory, and then identifying and extracting the password for the encrypted file within the `7-zip` archive. Following by analyzing the decrypted file and discovering a secret file hidden inside. The investigation concluded with the hashing of contents of the secret file, as its `MD5` hash served as the flag for the challenge.

### Findings and Analysis

| Finding | Finding Details | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **User Process** | `powershell.exe` (PID `5496`) | Running process found using `Volatility` on the memory and listing the running processes during its creation. |
| **Password** | `gift.7z` archive passkey `G6Vmc$Qd5cpM8ee#Ca=x&A3` | Found after running `strings` on the `powershell.exe` dump file and observing the output. |
| **File** | `secrets.txt` | Hidden file within the `suspicious.docx` document. Extracted using the `unzip` utility on the `suspicious.docx` file. |
| **Hash** | MD5 `0f235385d25ade312a2d151a2cc43865` | Flag required to complete the challenge, generated using `md5sum` to hash the contents of the `secrets.txt` file. |

### Methodology

#### Tools and Technologies Used

* **Volatility Framework 2.6.1 (`vol.py`):** Open-source memory forensics framework used for analyzing the `Emperor.vmem` memory dump with specific plugins.
* **PeaZip:** Archiving utility used for initial inspection of the `gift.7z` archive.
* `7-Zip`: Command-line utility used for extracting the encrypted `gift.7z` archive.
* `strings`: Command-line utility for extracting human-readable character sequences from binary files.
* `unzip`: Command-line utility for extracting files from `ZIP` archives (used for `.docx` files).
* `md5sum`: Command-line utility for computing and checking `MD5` hashes.
* **LibreOffice Writer:** A word processing application used to open and view the `suspicious.docx` file.

#### Investigation Process

1.  **Initial Files on Desktop:** Inspected the files on the desktop and identified `Emperor.vmem` as the memory dump and `gift.7z` as the archive with the encrypted file.

### Recommendations

1.  **Systematic Approach:** Always follow a structured methodology to ensure no stone is left unturned. Start broad and then narrow down.
2.  **Leverage Multiple Tools:** Don't rely on a single tool. If one doesn't yield results, try others.
3.  **Understand File Formats:** Knowledge of common file structures can reveal hidden data.
4.  **Don't Dismiss "Empty" Clues:** Investigate seemingly benign files for hidden content.
5.  **String Analysis is Powerful:** The `strings` utility can be very effective in revealing text-based secrets.
6.  **Document Everything:** Keep a detailed record of commands and findings.
