# Wazuh Deployment in VirtualBox: FIM, Custom Rules, and Active Response

### Project Overview

This project outlines establishing and managing a **Wazuh** security system. Key objectives include configuring `File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)`, creating specialized threat detection rules, and implementing automated active response. This process occurs in a **VirtualBox** environment using `Ubuntu Server` and `Client` `VMs`.

### Goals

* Deploy and manage a **Wazuh** security information and event management (**SIEM**) solution.

* Configure `File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)` for threat detection.

* Define custom detection rules to enhance security.

* Implement automated active response mechanisms.

### Task Summary

* **Task 1:** Connect to the `Ubuntu Server VM` and review the **Wazuh** quickstart guide for installation details (`Ubuntu Server`).

* **Task 2:** Install the **Wazuh Manager** on the `Ubuntu Server`, save web access credentials, and update them with the server's `IP` (`Ubuntu Server`).

* **Task 3:** Access the **Wazuh** dashboard to confirm manager status and prepare the `Ubuntu Client VM` for agent deployment (`Ubuntu Server`).

* **Task 4:** Configure agent package settings, specifying the operating system and manager's address (`Ubuntu Server`).

* **Task 5:** Name the new agent and obtain installation commands for client setup (`Ubuntu Server`).

* **Task 6:** Deploy the **Wazuh** agent on the `Ubuntu Client`, activate its service, and verify its active status in the **Wazuh** dashboard (`Ubuntu Client & Server`).

* **Task 7:** Configure `File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)` on the `Ubuntu Client` by creating a monitored directory, adjusting the agent's configuration, and generating a test file for verification (`Ubuntu Client`).

* **Task 8:** Verify `FIM` operation by checking the **Wazuh** dashboard for file addition events (`Ubuntu Server`).

* **Task 9:** Define a custom data leakage detection rule on the `Ubuntu Client`, deploy it to the **Wazuh Manager**, and activate it by restarting the manager service (`Ubuntu Client & Server`).

* **Task 10:** Verify custom rule deployment and configure active response to trigger with custom rule (Ubuntu Server).

* **Task 11:** Review and configure active response within the custom rule file on the `Ubuntu Client`. Observe the triggered active response and dashboard updates on the `Ubuntu Server` (`Ubuntu Client & Server`).
