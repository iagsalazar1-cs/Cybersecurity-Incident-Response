# **About this Repository**
This repository serves as a portfolio of my hands-on experience in cybersecurity incident response, threat analysis, and security monitoring. Each project write-up includes a detailed methodology, analysis of findings, and documentation of my workflow to demonstrate practical skills in a professional context.

### **Project Write-Ups & Labs**

#### **IR Certification Case Studies (CTF Challenges)** (In progress...)

- [**One of Us:**](https://github.com/your-username/Cybersecurity-Incident-Response/tree/main/One-of-Us-CTF-Challenge) This project documents a cybersecurity challenge focused on identifying a malicious file and its hash signature. The solution involved using custom Python scripts to automate file scanning and analyze the results, successfully identifying the malicious artifact.
