# One of Us - TDX Arena Certification Report

### Executive Summary

This project involved a cybersecurity challenge focused on identifying a malicious file and its hash signature on a compromised client system. I began by examining a directory on the Desktop filled with numerous suspicious executable files. Recognizing the limitations of the ClamAV web UI for bulk scanning, I opted for using an AI-generated Python script to automate the scanning of all files and save their results. Another script was then used to analyze these results. This process successfully identified `file176.exe` as the malicious artifact and extracted its MD5 hash signature, completing the primary objectives of the challenge.

### Findings and Analysis

| Finding | Finding Details | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Directory | `suspicious-files` | A directory found on the Desktop containing numerous potentially malicious `.exe` file artifacts. |
| File | `file176.exe.json` | Scan results of the infected file generated by a scan script, including the file's name, size, and hash. |
| File | `file176.exe` | The singular infected file identified in the `suspicious-files` directory. |
| Hash | MD5 - `f48a8687e91fd9ef98cd1b7aaeeb2a4c` | The MD5 hash of `file176.exe` obtained from the automated scan results. |

### Methodology

#### Tools and Technologies Used

* **ClamAV Web UI:** The primary web application for antivirus scanning.
* **Python 3:** The programming language used for scripting.
* `scan_script.py`: A custom Python script used to automate file scanning.
* `find_infected.py`: A custom Python script used to analyze scan results and identify infected files.
* `curl`: A command-line tool used for API authentication.
* `nano`: A text editor used in the terminal to create and modify Python scripts.
* **VirusTotal:** An online service for analyzing suspicious files and URLs.

#### Investigation Process

1.  **Environment Reconnaissance:** The `suspicious-files` directory was found with 272 `.exe` files, indicating potential malicious artifacts.
2.  **ClamAV UI Exploration:** Explored the ClamAV web UI, noting its lack of a built-in feature for scanning an entire directory.
3.  **Local ClamAV Attempt:** Failed to scan the `suspicious-files` directory with `clamscan` due to insufficient privileges.
4.  **ClamAV API Documentation Review:** Noted the JWT token requirement for secure authentication and file scanning.
5.  **Token Acquisition:** Successfully obtained ClamAV's authentication token using `curl`, bypassing an SSL certificate verification issue.
6.  **Python Environment Setup:** Confirmed Python 3 and `pip3` were available. Installed the `requests` library to enable HTTP requests in Python scripts.
7.  **Automated Scanning Script (`scan_script.py`):** Created and executed a Python script that parsed through all files in the `suspicious-files` directory and saved results to a new directory.
8.  **Scanning Script Verification of Results:** Verified that the `scan_results` directory was populated with individual result files, confirming successful automated scanning.
9.  **Scan Result Analysis (`find_infected.py`):** Created a second Python script to iterate through the `scan_results` directory and identify the infected file, which was successfully identified as `file176.exe`.
10. **Hash Signature Retrieval:** Examined the scan report in `file176.exe.json` to extract the malicious file's MD5 hash.
11. **VirusTotal Analysis:** Uploaded `file176.exe` to VirusTotal, which confirmed it as `trojan.shikataganai` malware.

### Recommendations

1.  **Implement Robust Endpoint Security:** Deploy and maintain up-to-date antivirus and EDR solutions across all systems, configured for real-time scanning and behavioral analysis to detect and block malware.
2.  **Regular System and Network Scans:** Schedule regular, comprehensive scans of all endpoints and network segments.
3.  **Automated Threat Intelligence Integration:** Integrate security tools with threat intelligence feeds (e.g., VirusTotal) for automated file hash checking.
