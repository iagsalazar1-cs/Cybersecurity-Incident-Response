# **About this Repository**
This repository serves as a portfolio of my hands-on experience in cybersecurity incident response, threat analysis, and security monitoring. Each project write-up includes a detailed methodology, analysis of findings, and documentation of my workflow to demonstrate practical skills in a professional context.

### **Project Write-Ups & Labs**

#### **IR Certification Case Studies (CTF Challenges)**

- [**One of Us:**](https://github.com/iagsalazar1-cs/Cybersecurity-Incident-Response/tree/main/01-One-of-Us) This project documents a cybersecurity challenge focused on identifying a malicious file and its hash signature. The solution involved using custom Python scripts to automate file scanning and analyze the results, successfully identifying the malicious artifact.

- [**Pigs Rules:**](https://github.com/iagsalazar1-cs/Cybersecurity-Incident-Response/tree/main/02-Pigs-Rules) A write-up detailing the development and deployment of a custom Snort IDS rule to detect and alert on malicious network activity, showcasing skills in intrusion detection system configuration.

- [**Imperial Memory:**](https://github.com/iagsalazar1-cs/Cybersecurity-Incident-Response/tree/main/03-Imperial-Memory) This project involved a memory forensics challenge where a memory dump and a 7-Zip archive were analyzed to uncover a hidden secret, demonstrating skills in digital forensics and artifact analysis.

- [**Mail n' Trail:**](https://github.com/iagsalazar1-cs/Cybersecurity-Incident-Response/tree/main/04-Mail-n-Trail) This write-up covers the analysis of Splunk logs to investigate suspicious honeypot activity and uncover the source of malicious downloads, highlighting my experience with SIEM tools and log correlation.

#### **Hands-On Labs** (In progress...)
- Splunk Dashboard and Alert Creation

- Wazuh Deployment in VirtualBox - FIM, Custom Rules, and Active Response
